<p>A Contact Management 'System' based on Siri Shortcuts, Data Jar, Toolbox Pro and OmniFocus </p>
<p>Before you continue reading: I'm not a programmer and who thinks this project is totally nuts: probably it is and if you think so too I kindly ask not to read on and preferably never come back here. there are certainly more elegant, easier, nicer and faster ways to build something like this and why not just download an app from the AppStore like UpHabit? Well, I even tried the latter and I know MS Dynamics as well. Both great applications that I only want to mention, they are like Major League compared to me in Little League. </p>
<p>My motivation for this project is quite simple: I was looking for a lightweight CRM based on iOS. On the one hand, I am a bad contact holder and have to write down things to be done, see my fondness for lists. Secondly, it is precisely in recent months that there has been a need to maintain very regular social contacts when personal meetings cannot happen, every sensible is sheltering in place as much as possible, right? Also an important fact is a personal disposition on my part, which I like to summarize under the heading "Who is lazy must not be dumb": a computer should not ask questions that it answer itself. So why not use the smartphone with an emphasis on "smart"? And I had to try to see if there was anything to do with Siri Shortcuts. At least for my needs it was and to my greater astonishment I am now suddenly standing there with this "system", who would have thought (I didn't)? So for those few of you who were brave enough to continue reading up to here finally a short overview of all Siri shortcuts for my miniCRM. At the moment, the whole thing consists of seven shortcuts, which I briefly describe and link below.</p>
<p>Here is the overview of all shortcuts: - CRM Entry: This shortcut adds a new entry to the CRM
- Contact history: what contacts with what content have taken place in the last 90 days? This shortcut lists them.
- Check recent entries: a quick look at the last CRM entry of a selected contact. This shortcut goes through the list of contacts, checks who should be contacted again, and creates a list in Omnifocus. The contact history shortcut is integrated here. It is the most elaborate of all shortcuts at the moment and true to the motto runs from above (keyword "smart") this shortcuts is automatically triggered with the help of autocuts. - Add a new contact: as the name suggests: here is a new contact added to the CRM?
- Change contact: Status of the relationship changes from colleague to customer or the clock frequency of the contacts should be adjusted? This shortcut does this: </p>
<p>The following apps are needed for the "CRM": - Apple's Shortcut app - Data Jar: there are three directories: CRM collects all interactions CRMkontakte includes the names of the contacts, the relationship status and the contact frequency CRMkontakttypen is a simple list of possible relationship stats. - Toolbox Pro for shortcuts (only for sorting in Check Last Entries)
- OmniFocus for the Task Management </p>
<p>Among other things, what is still missing: - Elegance: unnecessary entries appear in some menus. For example, if I want to check a contact, I don't need the "new" entry. Variables are still called different throughout the system. I can't put in one go more people than new contacts, etc. There is more the question "where to start?" than "what else needs to be done?"
- maybe at some point I'll be able to write all the information independently of Data Jar into files that are in iCloud and thus be independent of another app. What would be most surprising to me would be myself. - a proper "manual" or so </p>
<p>Finally, and for the sake of completeness, just the following note: this is pure private pleasure that I am doing here. There are no commercial interests with this tool – how could there? – and I am pleased to receive any constructive contribution to it and happy about anyone who can derive any benefit from this thing. And just wonder or amuse yourself about it... If anyone can really do anything useful with it: this would make me happy, let me know and please please make suggestions for improvement. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of all Shortcuts with links and a short and a brief description:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRM Log Contact: This shortcut is used to save interactions that have taken place in the data jar. First the relationship category is selected, then the person from the list of names available in CRMkontakte according to the category. Several people can be selected at the same time. The following is then entered: content of the conversation, type of interaction (telephone call, personal, video call or web conference). Everything is added as a dictionary in CRM under the name of the list of intactions. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6477</li>
<li>Overview last Contacts: The shortcut creates an overview of when and with what content the last interaction with each person listed in CRMkontakte took place (one entry per contact). The list is created in  Notes. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6478</li>
<li>CRM Check last Contact: With this shortcut, overdue contacts are transferred to OmniFocus as a phone list. For each contact in CRMkontakte, it is checked when the last interaction was and, based on the time interval stored there, the name is added to the telephone list. Two shortcuts are called from this shortcut: "CRM 1: 1 Review Drafts" and "CRM contact statistics for CheckContact". Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/</li>
<li>CRM Names to Data Jar: This shortcut is used to add new names to the CRMkontakte database. Either a name can be selected from the address book or a name can be entered. The shortcut then checks whether the name already exists and otherwise saves it in the specified directory. The contact frequency in days and the type of relationship can be specified from a list of specified values ​​(from CRM contact types). The contact frequency is required for the CRM Check last Contact shortcut. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6479</li>
<li>miniCRM: The "main menu" of the miniCRM. The core shortcuts can be started from here. There is also a link to a second menu that contains all the data manipulation shortcuts. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6015</li>
<li>miniCRM data manipulation: The submenu for the "miniCRM" shortcut. All shortcuts are gathered here and can be started to change the data in the Data Jar: change entries or contact details, add new contacts or new categories. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6481</li>
<li>Update CRM Contact: This shortcut changes values ​​in the CRM's name directory. Specifically, the values ​​for relationship type, contact frequency, qualification and grouping can be changed. The latter is helpful with employees. A shortcut-based name change is not yet possible, this has to be done manually in the Data Jar. In the latest version, several changes can be made to a selected contact without having to start the entire selection from the beginning. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6013</li>
<li>View CRM entry: This shortcut shows the last entry for an entry to be selected. The date and content of the last interaction is displayed, as well as whether this four telephone, video call, conference or in person took place. It is used to check an entry made last, but is actually obsolete with the "Change CRM entry". Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6482</li>
<li>CRM contact statistics for CheckContact: If a name appears on the telephone list for Omnifocus, some information is added to the note: the interactions of the last 90 days and, via this shortcut, statistics on how the interactions are distributed among the individual contact types. The shortcut is called automatically by "CRM Check last Contact". Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6489</li>
<li>CRM List in Drafts: This shortcut creates a list of people in a certain contact category in Drafts. The fields can be selected. The data come from CRM contacts. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6487</li>
<li>CRM New fields and batch filling: This shortcut creates a new key for the selected contact category and asks for the value for each entry. First of all, all keys available in the "CRMkontakte" data jar are displayed. Then you will be asked for the new key. If there is already a key, the shortcut indicates it. The key is then added for each name in the contact category. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6483</li>
<li>CRM date overview: The shortcut generates a daily overview of the interactions for the previous day. The names and the content as well as the type of interaction are listed. In addition to a list in drafts that is generated with the content, an action is also created in Omnifocus with the link to the draft. Link: https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6484</li>
