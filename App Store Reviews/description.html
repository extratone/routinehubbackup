</ul>
<p>This shortcut utilizes the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/98295">Apple App Store's RSS feeds</a> to retrieve up to 50 of the most recent reviews for an app from the standard <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/search-app-store/">Search App Store</a> ⇨ <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/choose-from-list/">Choose from List</a> ⇨ <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-details-of-app-store-app/">Get Details of App Store App</a> flow, which retrieves an app ID and inserts it into a URL in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/customerreviews/id={id}/sortBy=mostRecent/page=1/xml
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/customerreviews/id=1527500834/sortBy=mostRecent/page=1/xml">Here's the example feed</a> I drew from for the example output below and <a href="https://github.com/extratone/i/blob/main/docs/AppStoreReviewsExample.xml">the file found at the URL</a> (on my GitHub repo.)</p>
<p>Upon installation, you will be asked to set the default number of items for the <a href="https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-items-from-rss-feed/">Get Items from RSS Feed</a> to retrieve. (The feeds seem to support up to 50, so that's what I've set by default.)</p>
<p><em>Note: Though the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171">Actions App</a> is cross-platform and entirely free, if you absolutely refuse to download it, you'll need to remove its action before this Shortcut will run successfully.</em></p>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
<pre><code>Everything is fine, but not without flaws.
Everything is fine, but not without flaws. I would like it to be possible to like a post with a double click or slide. In general, I like everything, I bought a paid subscription to support the developer.
UX/UI can be weird and there are some bugs
My motivation in trying this out was mainly to use Twitter without ads and without all the other bad stuff they use to hook you (curated timelines, suggested stuff, etc.). I'm happy that this app doesn't have any of that stuff and I'm fine with paying a small subscription for that. I also liked all the customizability. Going between all the other social media apps I never have trouble getting around, but going from the normal Twitter app to this I had some trouble. Mainly the way you open a thread is to swipe, which I thought was totally bizarre. I did get into the habit of it, but when I'd go to a different app I'd be used to doing it the weird swipe way and I'd do something else by mistake. There's other weird UI stuff, like when you go to someones account pictures don't show up until you scroll down and hit &quot;show all tweets.&quot; I feel like there's lots of little slight misses like that that kinda make the experience a little clumsy. I also encountered a bug where a thread would not show replies sometimes. The reply count would be correct, but they wouldn't show up. This app seems cool, and I'd be excited to use it if all that stuff was fixed.
Do not get Not worth the subscription
Lame updates App it doesn’t release many updates and nothing much changes. Depends to much on twitter API for any cool features to be implemented. The app can be so much better if they worked on actually making it better. It’s not a free app so there should be more work put into it. Take advantage of screen size more customization for the user. Viewing images shouldn’t be hard Many things like UI can be changed and further customization should be done. Make the app feel better than the stock twitter app and a cleaner look. Twitter iffic is better
Literally unusable without subscription
I’ve used Tweetbot for over a decade now and bought several previous versions of this app. However, none of that matters now that they’ve moved to a subscription model. The app is excellently designed, but you literally can’t even like a tweet without the subscription. What a shame.
Unfair subscription terms
Beware: when you cancel a Tweetbot subscription, Tweetbot does NOT refund the unused portion of the subscription. What’s even more unsavory, Tweetbot tries to present this unfair business practice as good news, with a message saying, “Your family will be able to use Tweetbot until the next renewal date,” which is nine months from now. I will never use Tweetbot again.
The best twitter client for iPad hands down
I have been using this app for a while now and absolutely love the interface and look of it. The way it deals with polls is great considering how difficult Twitter has made it for third party clients. The safari extension has been very useful too. My only wish is that there was a way to enlarge the little “pop-up” view that shows when you redirect from a safari page. the iPad screen is so big please let me use it!
